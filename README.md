Portfolio project a team of three
# Introducrion
Welcome to our website, a shoe shopping website for businesses in Ethiopia. Our website aims to revolutionize the way Ethiopian shoe companies sell their products by providing an online platform for them to showcase their high-quality shoes. With most e-commerce companies not operating in Ethiopia, and many shoe sellers not having a website, our platform aims to eliminate the need for a physical store and make it easier for businesses to reach a wider audience. With the ability to scale quickly, our website is the perfect tool for businesses looking to expand and grow. The website is designed to make the process of showcasing and selling products as simple and efficient as possible, and we're excited to see the impact it will have on the Ethiopian shoe market.
