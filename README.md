# Project Title
  Shoe shopping website
 # Introducrion
Welcome to our website, a shoe shopping website for businesses in Ethiopia. Our website aims to revolutionize the way Ethiopian shoe companies sell their products by providing an online platform for them to showcase their high-quality shoes. With most e-commerce companies not operating in Ethiopia, and many shoe sellers not having a website, our platform aims to eliminate the need for a physical store and make it easier for businesses to reach a wider audience. With the ability to scale quickly, our website is the perfect tool for businesses looking to expand and grow. The website is designed to make the process of showcasing and selling products as simple and efficient as possible, and we're excited to see the impact it will have on the Ethiopian shoe market.

#Architecture
Our web framework follows Model-template-view (MTV) architectural pattern.The Model in Django represents the logical structure for storing and retrieving data transfer between the database and the view.The Model acts as a middleware between the view and the database.
Views is a Django function that receive a web request and return a web response
The response can be a simple HTTP response, an HTML template response, or an HTTP redirect response that redirects a user to another page
A template contains the static parts of the desired HTML output as well as some special syntax describing how dynamic content will be inserted.
